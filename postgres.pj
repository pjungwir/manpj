.SH "PERMISSIONS"

See default permissions for a user:

.PP
.RS
.nf
    \\ddp
.fi
.RE
.PP

Grant default permissions to a user (so they get the same permissions on future-created tables and views):

.PP
.RS
.nf
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO the_user;
.fi
.RE
.PP

You can use \\l to list privileges on each database.
.PP
You'll see lines like `db_user=CTc/postgres` and `=c/postgres`.
The name before the equals sign is the user with those privileges.
If there is no name, it means the special `PUBLIC` role, which is everyone.
The name after the slash is who granted the privileges.

.PP
c - connect to the database
.PP
C - create new schemas
.PP
T - create temporary tables
.PP

To see the permissions on a given table: \\z table_name. Or \\dp for all tables/views/sequences.
.PP
The letters mean (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/sql-grant.html):

.PP
a - insert (add)
.PP
r - select (read)
.PP
w - update (write)
.PP
d - delete
.PP
D - truncate (really delete)
.PP
x - references
.PP
t - trigger
.PP
* - and you can grant this privilege to others
.PP

Also for other objects (functions and schemas), you'll see:

.PP
X - execute
.PP
U - usage
.PP

.PP
Note that neither command shows default privileges, unlike

.PP
.RS
.nf
    SELECT  grantee, privilege_type
    FROM    information_schema.role_table_grants
    WHERE   table_name = 'foo'
    ;
.fi

.PP

.SH POSTGIS

On a Mac using Peter Eisentraut's Postgres formulae, use pex to install extensions. For example:

.PP
.RS
.nf
pex -g /usr/local/opt/postgresql@10 install postgis
.fi
.RE
.PP

And you can solve lots of compilation errors with the tricks from https://gist.github.com/skissane/0487c097872a7f6d0dcc9bcd120c2ccd
